# SW4_Week2_Review1
Sam is an engineer and asking for a promotion at work.  As he has turned in projects, they are rated on task accuracy, budgeting, and manpower.   
For a promotion to be granted, the HR department wants a program to have a baseline for Sam’s projects.  
Using variables and conditionals, give a baseline “Yes” (true) or “No” (false) for Sam and if “no”, the reason why for receiving a promotion based on these rules:

Task accuracy must be above 90% for all projects
Budgeting can have a 10% variance for all projects
Manpower cannot exceed 25% over for any project

A github repo has been created for Sam’s 4 projects he has worked on.   
Compute the tasks accuracy average, get the budget variance (estimate - actual) for each project, and see if the manpower difference is greater than 25% for any project.
If one fails, store the reason and report it in the program.
